# Project for the HKA Go-Fuzzing Seminar (WS 24/25)

The focus of this Seminar is to add support for non-default types to fuzz over

## Basic Types

The following basic types are natively supported by the go fuzzer:
* [] byte
* string
* bool
* byte
* rune
* float32
* float64
* int
* int8
* int16
* int32
* int64
* uint
* uint8
* uint16
* uint32
* uint64

## Libraries

The library [go-fuzz-headers](https://github.com/AdaLogics/go-fuzz-headers/tree/main) offers methods to fuzz over 
basic-types, structs, arrays and maps. The random data is created by obtaining a `[]byte` object from the `testing.F.Fuzz`
function. The byte-array is used as a seed in a pseudo random generator (`math/rand.NewSource`). All the basic types 
can be created from an array of bytes given some constraints like upper and lower bounds for array/string/map lengths.

First the remaining bytes of the initial array are consumed to populate values, then values from the generator are used.
This allows the deterministic creation of arbitrary amounts of data, based on the initial array of bytes.

go-fuzz-headers enables the programmer to fuzz directly on complex function inputs and abstracts the initialization of
random function arguments away. The downside is, that the code looks different from a native fuzz-test and and more 
importantly a significantly worse performance compared to native fuzz-tests.
The following code is a snipped from a [blog-post](https://adalogics.com/blog/structure-aware-go-fuzzing-complex-types) slightly altered.
```go
package fuzzing

import (
        "testing"
        fuzz "github.com/AdaLogics/go-fuzz-headers"
)


func Fuzz(f *testing.F) {
	    //this test tests nothing
	    //a new Struct is created a populated with random values
	    //noting else happens
        f.Fuzz(func(t *testing.T, data []byte) {
                fuzzConsumer := fuzz.NewConsumer(data)
                targetStruct := &Demostruct{}
                err := fuzzConsumer.GenerateStruct(targetStruct)
                if err != nil {
                        return
                }
				//TODO do things with targetStruct
				// targetStruct.doThings()...
        })
}

```
## *Experiment: can fuzzing over structs, arrays, maps, etc... be implemented in a way, resembling the regular syntax and performance of go fuzz tests?*

### Support for structs (exporting all exported Fields)



The custom [FuzzPlus](FuzzPlus.go) module enables us to fuzz over structs. 
A fuzz test using this module looks very similar to a regular fuzz test. The only difference is the line
`ff := FuzzPlus{f}`

*Caveat*: It only supports structs where all fields are exported.
 ```go
 // Works
 type goodStruct struct {
    First int
    Second string
 }
 
 // Nesting of structs is supported as well
 type goodNestedStruct struct {
    Nested goodStruct
	Val int
 }
 
 // Does not work
 type badStruct struct {
    first int
    Second string
 }
 ```

`FuzzPlus` is a wrapper over `testing.F`.
It enhances the `testing.F.Add` and the `testing.F.Fuzz` so they can handle structs.
`FuzzPlus` can be used like this:
```go
type myStruct struct {
	First  int
	Second string
}

type parent struct {
	Child1 myStruct
	Child2 myStruct
}

func FuzzPlusPlusEven(f *testing.F) {

	ff := FuzzPlus{f}

	var data1 = myStruct{1, "hallo"}
	var data2 = myStruct{2, "tsch√ºss"}

	var root = parent{data1, data2}

	ff.Add(root)

	ff.Fuzz(func(t *testing.T, in parent) {
		//this test is nonsense but it shows how things work
		res := Even(in.Child1.First)
		res2 := Even(in.Child2.First + 1)
		if res == res2 {
			t.Errorf("An Error, how sad")
		}
	})
}
```

#### Fuzzing with Structs - how does it work?

Each Fuzz test has a test corpus. The corpus is filled with initial values supplied in a variadic vector.

The FuzzPlus wrapper flattens all structs in the corpus. Nested structs are flattened as well.
The flattened values are passed to the `testing.F.Add(...)` method.

The wrapped `testing.F.Fuzz(func(t testing.T,...))` call is mapped to the `FuzzPlus.Fuzz(func(t testing.T,...))` function
where the arguments are un-flattened back into structs.
```
origin  := [int, MyStruct{string, int}, OtherStruct{bool, NestedStruct{string}, bool}, int8] <= original
//is flattend - depth first - into:
flattend :=[int,  string, int,  bool,        string,        bool, int8]                      <= flattend
//               { MyStruct  } {OtherStruct {NestedStruct }     }                            <= origin of values
//flattend is added to corups: testing.F.Add(flattend)
//testing.F.Fuzz(func(t testing.T, int, string, int, bool, string, bool, int8)) is un-folded
//NOTE: param names are omitted
//func(testing.T, int, MyStruct{string, int}, OtherStruct{bool, NestedStruct{string}, bool}, int8)
```

## Comparing native-fuzzing, custom-struct-fuzzing and fuzz-headers

In the following the performance expressed through necessary time and quality of the fuzzing is compared.
Time depends on the quality of the fuzzing, as a more refined fuzzer might need fewer attempts to find edge cases. But a higher
throughput might still make the other fuzzer come out on top. The custom-struct-fuzzing and fuzz-headers tests are working with structs.

The test-setup is the following:
There are two functions `F1(x) = x^3+4*x^2-2` and `F2(x) = x^4-1`. The fuzz-tests fail if an `x1` and `x2` are found so that
`F(x1) - F(x2) < 0.001`.

There seems to be a lot of variance in the number of required test-runs. On average the native-go tests are the fastest (avg. 4.25) and require the least number of attempts,
followed by the custom-struct tests (avg. 7.05) . In comparison, the fuzz-headers tests are rather slow and of poor quality (avg. 131.35s). This is expected,
because there is a lot of overhead required to parse random bytes to the desired data. Additionally, these tests can't be optimized
by the guided fuzzing approach of the native-go fuzzer, because the usage of pseudo-randomness make deterministic results harder because small
changes in the input can drastically change the output.

Avg. durations were calculated by running `go test go-seminar -fuzz ...` and measuring the time until an Error is thrown. The measurements therefore include setup times.
